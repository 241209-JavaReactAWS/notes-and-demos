    <!-- Let's make a page for a grilled salmon recipe. So normally on a recipe page there's usually 3
     different things we see on the page:
     
     A list of ingredients
     Steps to cook the food
     Nutritional Facts

     These 3 pieces relate very easily to 3 common structures you'll see in HTML pages:
     Unordered Lists
     Ordered Lists
     Table
     -->

    <h1>Grilled Salmon Recipe</h1>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <!-- So when preparing for a recipe normally you have to gather all of the materials before you cook
      and it really doesn't matter the order in which you grab them -->

    <ul>
        <li><a href="./images.html">Slab of salmon</a></li>
        <li>Avocado Oil</li>
        <li>Your favorite seasonings
            <ul>
                <li> salt</li>
                <li> pepper</li>
                <li> paprika</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <!-- <li><img src="./grilled-salmon-9-768x1152.jpg" height="100px"></li> -->
    </ul>

    <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>

    <!-- Cooking instructions are far more important in terms of ordering since you need to do in a specific way -->

    <ol>
        <li>On a cutting board you can clean easily, slice salmon slab into 8oz filets</li>
        <li>Preheat grill to 400 degrees</li>
        <li> Lightly drizzle oil onto the salmon</li>
        <li>Add you favorite seasonings</li>
        <li>Grill for 12 minutes and flip after 8</li>
    </ol>

    <!-- The final major structure we'll like see is a table
        Tables consist of rows and columns and they can be any dimensions 
    -->

    <h2> Nutritional Facts</h2>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Content</th>
            <th>Amount per Serving</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Protein</td>
            <td>34g</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Sugar</td>
            <td>0g</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
